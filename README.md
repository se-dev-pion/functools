# functools

A library enhancing functional programming support for Golang.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

functools requires Go version `1.18` or above.

### Getting functools

With Go's module support, `go [build|run|test]` automatically fetches the necessary dependencies when you add the import in your code:

```go
import "github.com/se-dev-pion/functools"
```

Alternatively, use `go get`:

```sh
go get -u github.com/se-dev-pion/functools
```

### Examples

Search `github.com/se-dev-pion/functools` on [Go Packages](https://pkg.go.dev/) and then you can see examples in the library document.
